# MvFilesToDir

Simple file organizer.

I just Created it to organize my movie files collection.

It just moves messy files inside some directory to directories with same file names without extensions, something that would be very tedious and error prone to do manually if you have a huge list of files.

Its under artistic license 2.0

Nice new features to new release? 
  It just works if application is located inside file list directory so:
  1)I beleave a new edit field for "From" -> "To", to avoid app be inside same directory as listfiles.
  2)Maybe the work can be done doing less loops. Pehaps with one single loop it can be done and aquire extra performance. (perceptible performance? Is it really needed? Since it already is veeeery fast).
  
  This project uses Jedi Vcl (JVCL) library.
